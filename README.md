## How to Apply

Send us by [email](mailto:an.nougaret@gmail.com):
- Minimal Resume (can be just a .txt file) with preferably: what projects you worked on, what tech jobs you had, what education you have
- Your GitHub account
- Describe within less than 10 sentences what is the one most impressive thing (technically, artistically or other) that you have done in your life.

## About you

From 0 to BAC+10, all that matters is:
- Impressive will to learn and build
- Impressive tech skills for where you're at
- Can work on-site in Paris as an intern
- Motivated by joining a early-stage startup adventure
- Great English fluency (French does not matter)

## What you will do & learn

As an intern you will most likely be amongst the first people to join us. You will be directly mentored by our CTO, Anicet. 

You will join at a early, critical & exciting period in the startup life (that we call "pre-PMF", where we raise money, hire first employees, secure first customers), that will teach you a ton about how launching a nascent startup works, and how to go from 0 to 1 technically. This could prove more valuable than a MBA or technical degree at a top school.

We only want technical people with the most potential to learn and grow with us. If you join, we will teach you all that you want to learn and that we know about: AI, rust, typescript, web programming, systems programming, software architecture & best practices, business, startups, funding.

A fixed AI full-stack software project will be agreed upon with you before the beginning. Your typical days will be 1/2 hour 1:1 mentoring with our CTO, 2 hours autonomous learning, 4 hours working on your project & report.

If we like both your human side and work side we will gladly allow you to join as an employee and help you relocate to San Francisco as we will ourselves move there after your internship. (No worries, the full internship will be in Paris with always at least one founder on-site).

## Our mission

We thrive to make software & AI tools that make developers and other code-adjacent roles (PMs, researchers, security auditors...) way more efficient at understanding code.
Code understanding tasks (review, troubleshooting, onboarding) are 75% of the time spent by pro developers. We see a future in 2 to 5 years were most code will be AI generated and developers' role will fully shift to theses code understanding tasks. We also see a future where the only way for humans to not be enslaved by AI is via their ability to still decipher and understand what AI does, which will probably require understanding a lot of code.

## Story
 
We founded the company in early January this year. We raised a pre-seed investment from Entrepreneur First, one of the best incubator and investor in the international startup scene. We have already released a first version of our product, and in the following months we aim to onboard paid customers, raise a seed round and prepare to relocate to San Francisco.

## Application process

1. Immediate Positive or Negative answer
2. If positive, short call with our CTO, Anicet (tech & non-tech questions, no coding required)
3. Short call with our CEO, Isaline
4. Call again with Anicet
5. Feedback whether fail or success
6. Offer hopefully :)
